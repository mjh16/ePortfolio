      <h2>Example Assignment: ePortfolio</h2>
      <h3>Project 4: ePortfolio</h3>
      <p>There are two major components to the ePortfolio: the assembled assignments and reflections, and the final
        reflection-in-presentation.</p>
      <h3 id="eportfolio">ePortfolio</h3>
      <p>The components of a complete ePortfolio are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Projects 1, 2, and 3</li>
        <li>Reflections for projects 1, 2, and 3. These should be updated to reflect any revisions done to the
          compositions for inclusion in the ePortfolio</li>
        <li>Two additional artifacts from this semester, they may be from this class or another context.
          <ul>
            <li>A short reflection for each artifact detailing why you choose it, and how you see it fitting into the
              work you did in this class</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>A final reflection-in-presentation that connects and draws from the assembled ePortfolio.</li>
        <li>Designed intentionally to help the audience navigate your compositions and learning.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="reflection-in-presentation">Reflection in Presentation</h3>
      <p>Reflection allows us the <strong>opportunity to process knowledge and then apply that knowledge</strong>.
        Through reflection, we can <strong>come to an understanding</strong> and <strong>interpret</strong> what we have
        learned. This semester, on several occasions, we have used reflection in this way; in this final assignment you
        will return to this definition of reflection.</p>
      <p>You have also been <strong>developing your theory of composing</strong> and what your theory of writing means
        in terms of <strong>its relationship to your compositions</strong>&ndash;i.e., you have been exploring whether
        you enact your theory of composing in your own compositions. As a result of this, you have had the opportunity
        to create a knowledge base of writing and its practices. In this final reflection, you will be returning to your
        theory to discuss several questions, including (but not limited to):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Define your theory of composing.</li>
        <li>What was your theory of composing coming into ENC 2135 (your notecard will help with this)? How has your
          theory of composing evolved with each project?</li>
        <li>What has contributed to your theory of composing the most?</li>
        <li>What is the relationship between your theory of composing and how you create(d) knowledge?</li>
        <li>How might your theory of composing be applied to other writing situations both inside and outside the
          classroom?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For each of these questions you will need <strong>to support your ideas with your previous
          compositions</strong> in this course and, <strong>through these examples, interpret what you have
          learned.</strong> You will create a compelling argument for whatever you decide to compose for this, supported
        by evidence and analysis of the work complete in class this semester.</p>
      <p>You will <strong>choose a genre to work in</strong>&ndash;letter, email, essay, journal entry, vlog, podcast,
        video game, song, dance number, or any genre you may desire that is approved by the instructor&ndash;that you
        feel best represents your goals for your reflection and then explains why you chose that genre. In turn, you
        will also describe how your chosen genre affects the outcome (the final product) of your reflection.</p>
      <p>This final reflection is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your increased knowledge in composing&ndash;the
        practices of composing, the key terms, and any specific skills you&rsquo;ve acquired. <strong>Think of this
          piece as another move in the evolution of your theory of composing,</strong> and a chance for you to fully
        explore yourself as a composer an maker of knowledge.</p>
      <h3>Student Evaluations</h3>
      <p>Includes formal university evaluations and informal student feedback</p>
