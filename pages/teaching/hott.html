      <h2>Example Course Syllabus</h2>
      <div id="syllabus"></div>
      <h2>Example Assignment: Archive of Text Technologies</h2>
      <h3>The Task</h3>
      <p>With a collaborative group, you will collect, select, and present a variety of textual artifacts within a
        digital archive for our entire class. We will start work early in the semester, and it will be ongoing
        throughout the term. This archive will feature a collection of artifacts that have been cataloged within the
        collection, with appropriate data and metadata to aid your team as researchers, our class, and future
        researchers. Each group will be responsible for proposing and developing an exhibit for the archive that It will
        also feature a collaborative exhibit that works between individual perspectives and those developed by your
        group.</p>
      <h3>Components and Requirements</h3>
      <h4>Curating Artifacts</h4>
      <p>As a member of your group, each person will be responsible for selecting and curating a set of 10 text
        technology artifacts. Each curated artifact will be catalogued using the Dublin Core to establish metadata for
        the artifacts. You have free range over what you choose for the artifacts, and you are welcome to do your own
        research, including starting with artifacts that we have already examined in class. It is up to you to make the
        choice, as a researcher and curator, if it is an artifact of a text technology to digitally preserve in our
        course archive. The archive will persist beyond this semester, being added to by future HoTT sections, and each
        one will have an opportunity to define text technologies and grow the archive.</p>
      <h4>Curation Requirements</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>At least 10 artifacts</li>
        <li>A digital representation of each artifact - image, file, video, audio, pdf, etc.</li>
        <li>Metadata for each artifact - see the curation guide</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Collaborative Exhibit</h3>
      <p>Drawing from the entire archive, each group is responsible for proposing and implementing a featured exhibit of
        text technologies. This will take the form of an exhibit on Omeka. These exhibits will explore some aspect of
        the history of text technologies that your group finds interesting, thought provoking, difficult, or worth
        exploring. You will have free range over the topic of the exhibit, but it will need to be related or emergent
        from the themes of the class. These will draw primarily from the artifacts already curated in the archive,
        although you are welcome to curate additional artifacts if it will help with your exhibit.</p>
      <h4>Exhibit Requirements</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Proposal that is specific and relevant - you will receive both peer feedback and instructor feedback on the
          proposal</li>
        <li>At least 1 page per person in the group which highlights at least 2 artifacts</li>
        <li>An overall feature or theme to the exhibit that is continuous throughout the pages</li>
        <li>Anything referenced is cited (readings, resources, materials)</li>
      </ul>
