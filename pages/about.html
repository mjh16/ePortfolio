                    I earned my PhD in Rhetoric and Composition in August of
                    2021 from Florida State University. I work as a Visiting
                    Teaching Faculty member at FSU where I teach college
                    composition and courses in the Editing, Writing, and Media
                    concentration in the English Major. in scholarship from the
                    1990s. My dissertation,
                    <i
                        >Tracing Techne: Distributed Histories of Invention,
                        Creativity, and Text-Technologies in Rhetoric and
                        Composition Scholarship from the 1990s</i
                    >
                    utilized the digital humanities and data feminism to study
                    the histories and historograpies <i>techne</i> through the
                    concept's presences and impressions within a corpus of field
                    journals. My research interests are at the intersections of
                    the digital humanities, data feminism, <i>techne</i>, and
                    historiography, with a particular focus on the roles of
                    history have on shaping conceptions about <i>techne</i> and
                    how those histories shape writing curriculums and
                    pedagogies. I also have interests in rhetoric and code,
                    design, creative nonfiction, play, convergences between
                    creative writing and composition pedagogies, and the
                    undergraduate major in writing and rhetoric.

                <p>
                    I am originally from Omaha Nebraska, where I completed my BA
                    in English with a Creative Writing Focus at Creighton
                    University in 2010. I received an MA in English from the
                    University of Nebraska-Omaha in 2016. When I'm not teaching,
                    researching, or writing, I enjoy running, cooking, and
                    watching Star Trek with Jessi and our two golden retrievers,
                    Mardi and Janeway.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have crafted this ePortfolio as a showcase of my projects
                    and interests, and as a place to assemble and practice the
                    many different digital and networked tools and technologies
                    that I use in my teaching, writing, and research. You can

                    sections of the ePortfolio.

                <h4>Acknowledgments</h4>
                <p>
                    I would also like to thank all of the people who have helped
                    get me to this point. Dr. Kennedy, who asked (or told) me to
                    apply for the English MA and teaching assistant position at
                    UNO, and who's challenge and encouragement have helped me
                    get to this point. Dr. Yancey for pushing me to be the best
                    version of a student, teacher, and scholar that I could be,
                    both inside and outside of the classroom. For Michael Neal,
                    for showing how care for students, for self, for family, and
                    for others can become a central role to the work we do, and
                    that caring for entrusted to our care is a source of
                    strength. For Dr. Fleckenstein, who's pointed feedback and
                    imaginative suggestions have shaped much of my work. For my
                    advisor, Dr. Graban, for never ceasing to inspire me to
                    think of how my work impacts the world, for thoughtful
                    feedback, for the wisdom to know when to push me and when to
                    give me some space, and for opening up so many opportunities
                    for me to learn, play, and explore.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To the members of my writing group-Anna, Jessi, Brenda, and
                    Amanda-that you for the time, the focus, the conversations,
                    and the feedback. I don't know if I would have done as much
                    if it wasn't for you all. For the members of FSU's rhetoric
                    and composition program. Working with you all has been a
                    joy, and I have learned so much from each and every one of
                    you inside and outside of the Williams Building. To my
                    students, you have taught me so much, on how to be a person,
                    teacher, collaborator, and mentor. I am here because I find
                    great joy in working with you all, and from watching you
                    grow as critical people, writers, and thinkers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But most of all, thank you to Jessi. I would not be here if
                    it wasn't for you, and while it hasn't always been easy, it
                    has been so worthwhile. I can think of no one else who I'd
                    want to be doing all of this with. You are my partner, you
                    are my person, and you make me a better me.
