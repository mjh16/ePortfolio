        I am a PhD candidate at Florida State University. I am currently working on a dissertation that uses Digital Humanities methods to trace the intersections of <i>techne</i>, text-technologies, and creativity in 1990s Rhetoric and Composition Scholarship in order to craft a historiography and to inform contemporary theories of digital and networked invention. I hope to take what I learn from the project to inform my thinking on curriculum and pedagogy, especially when it comes to the undergraduate writing and rhetoric major.
        <br><br>
        I am originally from Omaha Nebraska, where I completed my BA in English with a Creative Writing Focus at Creighton University in 2010. I received an MA in English from the Univeristy of Nebraska-Omaha in 2016.
        <br><br>
        When I'm not teaching, researching, or writing, I enjoy running, cooking, and watching Star Trek with Jessi and our two golden retrievers, Mardi and Janeway.
        <br><br>
        I have crafted this ePortfolio as a showcase of my projects and interests, and as a place to assemble and practice the many different digital and networked tools and technolgies that I use in my teaching, writing, and research. You can follow the menu at the top right to get to different sections of the ePortfolio.
