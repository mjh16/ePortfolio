      <h3 class="title">Playing with Data, Language, and Historiography</h3>
      <p>When I examine my current research and reflect upon my future research trajectory, I see three main threads
        emerging from my work: play as a classroom pedagogy; curriculum development and assessment in the undergraduate
        major in writing and rhetoric; and digital historiography and digital archives. I see these different threads as
        overlapping and related to my teaching and service.</p>
      <h4>Data, Technology, and Historiography</h4>
      <p>My dissertation, “Tracing <i>Techne</i>: Distributed Histories of Invention, Creativity, and Text-Technologies
        in Rhetoric and Composition Scholarship from the 1990s,” uses data drawn from a corpus of rhetoric and
        composition field journals from the 1990s to inform and critique disciplinary histories and historiographies.
        This research has led to acceptances to the 2020 and 2021 Conference on College Composition and Communication
        and the 2020 Rhetoric Society of America Biennial Conference. I presented “Historiography, Hospitality, and
        Data,” a talk on using computational methods to examine and perform historiography, to the Rhetoric Society of
        America FSU Student chapter in May of 2020.</p>
      <p>Chapter one and three of this project will eventually contribute to the development of a research tool for
        performing time-series searches of textual data and generating visualization for tracing of keywords within
        large data sets. Alongside the tool, chapters four and five of the project provide the basis for an article that
        critiques historiographies of <i>techne</i> and the discipline of rhetoric and composition and explores how they
        inform current theories of <i>techne</i>. </p>
      <h4>Pedagogy and Play</h4>
      <p>I also have an interest is play in theory and pedagogy. I found a deep love for language, and how language
        could become manifest in materials and moments through my scenic route through my education. Play draws a bridge
        to the work being done already in rhetoric and composition, and especially within the computers and writing
        community, to gaming, gamification, and pedagogy. I presented on play and pedagogy with “A Symbiotic (and
        Pedagogical) Relationship: Forging an Alliance between Creative Nonfiction and Composition” at the 2017
        Conference on College Composition and Communication and “The Efficacy of Play as an Organizational and
        Pedagogical Theory” at the 2017 South Atlantic MLA conference. I have also presented at FSU about play and
        invention in the writing center and in the composition classroom. I am also currently finalizing a manuscript on
        play within the college composition classroom.</p>
      <h4>Undergraduate Curriculum</h4>
      <p>My third area of interest is in the undergraduate major in rhetoric and writing, especially in considering the
        curriculum and assessment. This work has led to a co-authored chapter “Institutional Matters: The Localized
        Conditions of WPA Labor,” that deals with, in part, the undergraduate major through the localized experiences of
        writing program administrators and the education of graduate writing program administration education. This
        research interest has also been shaped by my time teaching within Florida State’s editing, writing, and media
        major in the English department. At the 2019 Feminisms and Rhetoric Conference I presented “Student Activism,
        Assemblage, and the History of Rhetoric,” on a panel that explored using assemblage theory in pedagogy, and my
        talk was focused on using assemblage to engage students with their activism in the context of a rhetoric class.
        I was also accepted to the 2020 Conference on College Composition and Communication for a proposal considering
        how data can be used in the teaching of advanced composition. I also see this work with the undergraduate major
        as serving as an intersection for service and research, and a rich area for collaboration. </p>
